# Advent of Code 2024

[Sam LaGrave](https://samlagrave.com/)'s Advent of Code (2024) submissions.

## Languages

As a self-professed "language nerd", I want to use Advent of Code to sharpen my skills in programming languages I don't use too much. I will likely do each day in Python 1st, since that's the language I'm most familiar with. After that, I may rewrite the day in a different language. I'll use this table to keep track.

| Day             | Python              | [Roc](https://www.roc-lang.org/) | Rust |
| --------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---- |
| [01](./day01/)  | :heavy_check_mark:  | :o:                              | :o:  |
| [02](./day02/)  | :heavy_check_mark:  | :o:                              | :o:  |
