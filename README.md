# Advent of Code 2024

[Sam LaGrave](https://samlagrave.com/)'s Advent of Code (2024) submissions.

## Languages

As a self-professed "language nerd", I want to use Advent of Code to sharpen my skills in programming languages I don't use too much. I will likely do each day in Python 1st, since that's the language I'm most familiar with. After that, I may rewrite the day in a different language. I'll use this table to keep track.

| Day             | Title              | Python              | Rust               |
| --------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| [01](./day01/)  | Historian Hysteria | :heavy_check_mark:  | :o:                |
| [02](./day02/)  | Red-Nosed Reports  | :heavy_check_mark:  | :o:                |
| [03](./day03/)  | Mull It Over       | :heavy_check_mark:  | :heavy_check_mark: |
| [04](./day04/)  | Ceres Search       | :heavy_check_mark:  | :o:                |

## Notes

- **Why I've done day 3 in Rust**
  - Each year, there is one problem that get's built upon over several puzzles. It's often a bytecode or language based puzzle. I expect it will be the memory system started today.
  - Because of this, I wanted to make a system that is more easily expandable.
  - I also just like [pest.rs](https://pest.rs) and wanted an excuse to use it.
